## Constructor

The Vector.py file contains the code for the Vector class. The constructor of the Vector class accepts any number of comma-separated floating-point numbers 
as input. The class supports all n-dimensional vectors.

## Methods

The Vector class uses operator overloading to allow for more user-friendly inputs for the vector operations of addition, 
subtraction, dot-product, and cross-product. All other operators are written as methods of the vector class.

Operators that take in another vector as a parameter assume the vectors are of the same length. These operaors will raise a ValueError if 
the two vectors do not have the same number of dimensions.

### +

The + operator returns the sum of two vectors

### -

The - operator returns the difference of two vectors.

### *

The * operator returns the dot product of two vectors.

### **

The ** operator returns the cross product of two vectors. 
**Note this operation only works for two and three dimensional vectors**

### scale(scalar)

The scale method accepts a floating-point number as a parameter and returns the scalar multiple of the original vector.

### get_length()

The get_length method returns the length of the vector

### get_unit_vector()

The get_unit_vector method returns a unit vector in the direction of the original vector.

### get_interior_angle(other, radians=True)

The get_interior_angle method accepts another vector and a boolean as parameters. The method calculates the interior angle 
between the original vector and the other vector in radians if the boolean is True and in degrees if it is false.

### get_scalar_projection(other)

The get_scalar_projection method accepts another vector as a parameter and returns the scalar projection of the 
original vector onto the provided vector.

### get_vector_projection(other)

The get_vector_projection method accepts another vector as a parameters and returns the vector projection of the original vector onto the provided vector.

### is_perpendicular_to(other)

The is_perpendicular_to method accepts another vector as a parameter and returns a boolean to indicate whether or not the 
two vectors are perpendicular to one another.

### is_parallel_to(other)

The is_parallel_to method accepts another vector as a parameter and returns a boolean to indicate whether or not the 
two vectors are parallel to one another.

### print_summary()

The print_summary method prints the vector to the console. This method is utilized by all others to print the results of each operation.
